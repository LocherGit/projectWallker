# Project Wallker -If there is a wall, there is a way-
Project Wallker is a gameplay prototype that was created using [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com).<br>
Please regard this game as some kind of puzzle plattformer.

This project was endorsed and motivated by the Stuttgart Media University, located in Germany.<br>
This project took one semester to complete. (Summer Semester 2019)<br>

# What is the Gameplay about?
Basically, you, the Wallker, push yourself against walls to build up a vector that can then be activated at will.<br>

The Wallker not only saves the strength of the vector but also the direction of where the wall is "facing". <br>That way we have contextual situations, depending on which wall the player used to build up the vectors.<br>

Activation of the vector will consume the vector and trigger a dash that propells the player in the direction of the vector. <br>This dash could be super freaking strong.<br>

There you have it! A nice gameplay element that has lots of use-cases:<br>
- **Crashing** through objects
- Have some speedy **races**
- **Jumping** over obstacles
- **Pushing** heavy objects. 
You name it!
